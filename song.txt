Upon a dark hall, stands a great fortress of Lords.
Some strong warriors have their home in this darkness.
Our land
is the most beautiful on the east.
Warriors, companions and our friends live here in harmony.
And our courage is the blessing of the minotaurs.
Prepare your axes because there comes victory!
May the blessing of the ancients be with you!
